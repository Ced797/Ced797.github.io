				<p><b>With the M-Series Sony created an</b> enticing mp3 player, noise cancellation, S-Master MX amp, metal design and Bluetooth. Walkmans generally tend to have quite good battery life and the M is no exception, rated at 9-15 hours depending on settings, I easily achieved similar results with Bluetooth and NC on. But on the flipside, a few more hours would have been nice, 12 with NC and Bluetooth would have been ideal. The addition of AptX is plus, battery does take a hit but you have increased sound quality over Bluetooth, a trade-off I can live with. Of course nothing is perfect, the 8GB capacity is one detail which may turn some users away but if you are only using it for a few hours or exercising, then 8GB is plenty. Other issues are minor, for example connecting using NFC did not always work with my Z1 or A-Series, I would receive an error message or it would just keep connecting and connecting until I turned it off.</p>
				<p>The other issue is the clip on the back, it only attaches in one position and while its build quality is generally above average, the actual clip does not attach with much force. There are 3 teeth/ridges in the clip and this is not enough with the clip sometimes unlatching from a strap or coat. There are other accessories available in Japan like the CKS-NWM500 but this was never available here in Europe as far as I can tell.</p>

				<p>The M is a good solid little Walkman, I would recommend it to someone over the B-Series no questions asked but compared to the A-Series, A10/A20, I might reconsider, especially now that the A20 comes with NC and bundled mediocre NC headphones. The new A is priced significantly higher but it does feature expandable storage and Hi-Res support, along with better battery life. The M has been discontinued in Japan, so I would not expect a new model to take its place anytime soon, so if you are interested in the M, I would suggest grabbing one within the next 6-12 months, otherwise I feel it will be discontinued in Europe as well.</p>
